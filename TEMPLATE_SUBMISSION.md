# Hackathon Submission: Appwrite Portfolio Builder

## GitHub handle

## Project Title

Appwrite-Powered Online Portfolio Builder

## Project Description    

We built a responsive web app that helps creatives launch polished portfolios in minutes. Users can register, curate projects with rich media, control visibility, and publish a shareable public profile backed entirely by Appwrite services.

## Inspiration behind the Project  

Many designers and developers still struggle to showcase their work without wrestling with custom hosting or CMS setups. We wanted to remove that friction by combining Appwriteâ€™s managed backend with a modern React front end so anyone can ship a professional portfolio fast.

## Tech Stack    

- React 19 with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Appwrite Authentication, Databases, Storage, and Realtime SDKs
- React Scripts toolchain for local development and builds
